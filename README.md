		About Me
	</font></h1>
	<font face="helvetica" color="black" size="3">
		It aint no secret that I am a  gym rat. I have been focusing a lot on my gym core lately but the only thing that throws me off is the eating. Due to that you have to be on a balanced diet or at least good enough to burn them down at each workout section. In my case I have a trainer that helps me out a lot but however no matter how hard he tries to help me, I know that it depends on me to be accountable on my own.

   		<td>[Piece 2: In this piece I tried to capture the pure opposite of penguin-ness. The design was especially challenging here because representing objects along a four-dimensional plane proved to require more string theory than I had originally hoped.]</td>
   		<td>[Piece 3: This piece was inspired by the Oregon Trail during a zombie apocalypse. In the multiplicity of materials used, I tried to symbolize the lingering interposition of the Freudian superego along Jungian archetypes throughout Viennese architecture.]</td>
