		About Me
	</font></h1>
	<font face="helvetica" color="black" size="3">
		It aint no secret that I am a  gym rat. I have been focusing a lot on my gym core lately but the only thing that throws me off is the eating. Due to that you have to be on a balanced diet or at least good enough to burn them down at each workout section. In my case I have a trainer that helps me out a lot but however no matter how hard he tries to help me, I know that it depends on me to be accountable on my own.

   		<td>Piece 2:In this piece I wanted to make something with political significance showing the current suffering happpening in Palestine during these times of war. I used multiple images and collaged them together.</td>
   		<td>Piece 3: In this piece I put together a bunch of images that represent my type of "vibe" that I love. This is a collage of things that represent who I am but also provide some type of comfort.</td>
